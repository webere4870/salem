                  The Bible
                </a>

                <!-- Content -->
                <div class="faq-item-content collapse" id="faq-item-content-1">

                      <i class="text-primary">What is the Word?</i><br/>

                      We believe and teach that the Bible, comprised of 66 divinely inspired books, were written down by human
authors guided by the Holy Spirit (2 Peter 1:20-21). <br/><br/>
<i class="text-primary">Verbal Inspiration</i><br/>
We believe and teach in verbal, plenary inspiration that every word in the original manuscripts is without error
(inerrancy) and completely reliable (infallibility), the very Word of God (Psalm 119:160).<br/><br/>

<i class="text-primary">Authority, Inerrancy, Infallability</i><br/>
We believe and teach the Scriptures are the sole authoritative and objective standard for all matters of faith,
practice, and doctrine (Psalm 19:7-11; Matthew 24:35; John 17:17; 2 Timothy 3:16-17; 2 Peter 1:3-4, 19).
Holding God&#39;s objective truth, the Bible stands above all creation, humanity, and the church, serving as the
ultimate judgment point (John 5:39; Romans 15:4; 1 Corinthians 10:11; Hebrews 1:1; Jude 3; Revelation 1:19).<br/><br/>

<i class="text-primary">Approved Workmen</i><br/>
Recognizing the Bible&#39;s authority, we are responsible for its accurate handling and interpretation (2 Timothy
2:15). There are many applications of any given passage of Scripture, but there is only one true interpretation:
the author&#39;s originally intended meaning, which remains binding across generations. The meaning of Scripture
is found as one diligently applies the literal, grammatical-historical method of interpretation; this approach
emphasizes understanding the Bible within its immediate, broader, and historical contexts, prioritizing the
original languages, grammar, and sentence structure. The Holy Spirit enlightens us as we diligently apply this
method, helping us discover this intended meaning (John 7:17; 1 Corinthians 2:7-15; 1 John 2:20). Though
some portions may be challenging (2 Peter 3:16), the Bible remains sufficiently clear for us to understand (Ps.
19:7; 119:130; Matthew 12:3, 5; 19:14; 21:42; 22:31), especially regarding matters of salvation (2 Timothy
3:15; James 1:18; 1 Peter 1:23).

                    <p class="mb-0">
                      We believe and teach in one God (Deuteronomy 4:35; 6:4; Isaiah 44:5-8), an infinite, all-knowing, self-existent
Spirit, perfect in all His attributes. This one God eternally exists in three distinct persons – Father, Son, and
Holy Spirit – each equally deserving worship and obedience (Matthew 28:19; 2 Corinthians 13:14; Titus 3:4-7). <br/><br/>
<i class="text-primary">God the Father</i><br/>
We believe and teach in God the Father, the first Person of the Trinity. He is the initiator, planner, and
organizer of all things, exercising sovereign rule over creation, providence, and redemption (Job 38-41; Isaiah
14:24, 27; 37:26; Acts 4:27-28; Romans 8:29-30; 1 Corinthians 2:7; Ephesians 1:5, 11; 2:10). <br/><br/>
<i class="text-primary">God the Son</i><br/>
We believe and teach that Jesus Christ, the second person of the Trinity, embodies all divine excellencies
(Isaiah 9:6; Micah 5:2; Matthew 1:23; John 1:1, 14, 18; Philippians 2:5-8; Hebrews 1:8), existing eternally
alongside the Father in perfect equality (coequal, consubstantial, coeternal).<br/><br/>
We believe and teach that God the Father created the universe and sustains all things through Jesus Christ
(John 1:3; Colossians 1:15-17).<br/><br/>

<i class="text-primary">Incarnation</i><br/>
We believe and teach that this eternally existing Son took on human form in the incarnation, becoming the
God-Man, Jesus Christ (John 1:14). Though taking on human limitations, He remained sinless (Hebrews 4:15).
Virgin-born, fully God and fully man (Isaiah 7:14; Matthew 1:23), Jesus revealed God&#39;s nature (John 1:18) and
became humanity&#39;s Redeemer (Galatians 3:13).<br/><br/>

<i class="text-primary">Imputation and Sacrificial Atonement</i><br/>
We believe and teach that through Jesus’ perfect obedience (Hebrews 7:28) and sacrificial death on the cross
(Isaiah 53:4-6; 1 Peter 3:18), Jesus accomplished our salvation. This wasn&#39;t a mere technicality; He shed His
blood, a true sacrifice (1 Corinthians 15:3). Jesus is the one and only mediator between God and man, living as
an advocate for all who repent of their sins and believe in Him alone for their salvation (1 Timothy 2:5; 1 John
2:1). His sacrifice is evident in His literal, physical resurrection from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:4) and
ascension to the Father&#39;s right hand (Acts 1:9-11). Jesus&#39; bodily resurrection also guarantees a future
resurrection life for all believers (1 Corinthians 15:20-22).<br/><br/>
<i class="text-primary">Second Coming</i><br/>
We believe and teach that Jesus Christ will return to rapture the Church, His Body (1 Thessalonians 4:13-17).
He will then establish His millennial kingdom on earth (Revelation 20:1-6), demonstrating His Lordship over all
creation (Matthew 28:18). As the One through whom God will judge all mankind (John 5:22-23; Acts 17:31),
Jesus Christ reigns supreme.<br/><br/>
<i class="text-primary">God the Holy Spirit</i><br/>
We believe and teach that the Holy Spirit, the third person of the Trinity, is fully God, possessing all divine
attributes including intellect, emotion, will, and truthfulness (1 Corinthians 2:10-13). He is coequal and
consubstantial with the Father and the Son (Romans 8:1).<br/><br/>
<i class="text-primary">The Spirit in Creation, Regeneration, Advocation, and Teaching</i><br/>
We believe and teach that the Holy Spirit plays a vital role in God&#39;s plan. He was active in creation (Genesis
1:2), the incarnation (Luke 1:35), and inspiring the Bible (Zechariah 7:12; 2 Peter 1:20-21). He convicts the
world of sin and judgment (John 16:8), regenerates believers (Ezekiel 36:27; John 3:5-8), and empowers them
for service (Galatians 5:16; Titus 3:5). He also indwells and sanctifies believers, enabling them to understand
God&#39;s Word (1 Corinthians 2:10-16; 1 John 2:20, 27) and transforming them into the image of Christ (Romans
8:13-14). The Holy Spirit is the divine Teacher who guided the apostles and prophets (John 16:13), and His
presence is a gift bestowed on all believers from the moment of salvation (Ephesians 1:13). Believers are
called to be filled with the Holy Spirit through His Word (Ephesians 5:18).<br/><br/>

<i class="text-primary">The Spirit in Gift-Giving</i><br/>
We believe and teach that the Holy Spirit distributes spiritual gifts for the building up of the Church (1
Corinthians 12:11, 18). These gifts glorify Christ, not Himself or the gifts themselves (2 Corinthians 3:18). While
miraculous sign gifts like speaking in tongues served a purpose in the early church to authenticate the apostles

(Acts 5:3-4), they are not characteristic of all believers today (1 Cor. 12:4-11; 13:8-10; 2 Cor. 12:12; Eph. 4:7-
12; Heb. 2:1-4).

                      <i class="text-primary">Imago Dei, the Fall</i><br/>
                      We believe and teach that man was created directly by God in His image and likeness, perfect and without sin,
on the sixth day of creation (Genesis 1:24-31; Isaiah 43:7; Colossians 1:16-18). This meant man had a rational
nature, intelligence, free will, and the responsibility to glorify God (Ecclesiastes 7:29). However, shortly after
creation, Adam and Eve disobeyed God (Genesis 3:17; 2 Corinthians 11:3; 1 Timothy 2:14). This act resulted in
both spiritual and physical death (Ephesians 2:1-2; Genesis 5:5; Romans 6:23; Hebrews 9:27). <br/><br/>
<i class="text-primary">Original Sin, Federal Headship</i><br/>
We believe and teach that the consequence of Adam&#39;s sin, as the legal representative of humanity, is far-
reaching. This sin is imputed to all his descendants, making all men inherently corrupt and utterly incapable of
choosing or doing what is acceptable to God apart from divine grace (Romans 5:12-14; Ephesians 2:1-3). We
are all sinners by nature, by choice, and by divine declaration (Romans 3:10-18, 23). This total depravity means
every part of our being is affected by sin, rendering us unable to understand God, please Him, or seek Him on
our own (1 Corinthians 2:14; Romans 8:5-8; John 3:19-21; 2 Thessalonians 2:10-12). Our salvation, therefore,
rests entirely on God&#39;s grace through the redemptive work of Jesus Christ (Romans 5:1).<br/><br/>
<i class="text-primary">The Five Solas</i><br/>
We believe and teach that salvation is wholly of God&#39;s grace, based solely on the redemption of Jesus Christ
and the merit of His shed blood, not on any human merit or works (John 1:12; Eph. 1:7; 2:8-10; 1 Pet. 1:18-19).
This is because all humanity is in need of salvation from sin and its consequences. Unrepentant sinners face
God&#39;s wrath, ultimately suffering its full expression for eternity in the lake of fire (John 3:36; Romans 3:23-24;
6:23; Ephesians 2:3; Nahum 1:3; Revelation 20:14-15).<br/><br/>
<i class="text-primary">The Church</i><br/>
We believe and teach that the Bible teaches that all who place their faith in Jesus Christ are united by the Holy
Spirit into one spiritual body, the Church, which is the bride of Christ with Him as its Head (Ephesians 1:22-23).
This Church began on the Day of Pentecost (Acts 2) and will be complete when Christ returns for His followers
(1 Thessalonians 4:13-17). It&#39;s distinct from Israel and is a unique entity designed by Christ, made up of all
believers in the present age (Romans 11:25-26).<br/><br/>
<i class="text-primary">Local Body</i><br/>
We believe and teach that local churches are established throughout Scripture (1 Corinthians 1:2), and
believers are called to associate with these local assemblies (Hebrews 10:25). Christ is the Church&#39;s supreme
authority, and He has established leadership, gifts, order, discipline, and worship through the Scriptures
(Ephesians 5:23).<br/><br/>
<i class="text-primary">Leadership Qualifications</i><br/>
We believe and teach that Elders (also called pastors or bishops) and Deacons are the biblically designated
leaders who must meet specific qualifications and serve in a godly manner (1 Timothy 3:1-13). These leaders
serve as Christ&#39;s servants and have His authority in directing the church, with the congregation submitting to
their leadership (Hebrews 13:17). Their role is to equip believers for ministry and build up the body of Christ
(Ephesians 4:11-12).<br/><br/>

We believe and teach that the church&#39;s primary purpose is to glorify God (Ephesians 1:6) through worship,
serving as the pillar and support of His truth (1 Timothy 3:15), and carrying out its God-assigned mission.
We believe and teach that two ordinances have been committed to the local church: baptism and the Lord’s
Supper (Acts 2:38-42).<br/><br/>
<ul>
  <li>Christian baptism by immersion is a public act of obedience for believers who have already placed their
    faith in Jesus Christ (Acts 2:38, 41). It beautifully symbolizes the inward reality of being united with
    Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection (Romans 6:3-6). Through baptism, believers not only
    demonstrate their faith in the crucified, buried, and risen Savior, but also their new life in Christ and
    their identification with the visible Body of Christ (John 3:23; Acts 8:39). Baptism is not a means of
    salvation; it is an outward expression of the inward reality of grace already received through faith in
    Jesus Christ alone.</li>
    <li>The Lord&#39;s Supper is a central act of remembrance and obedience within the Christian community.
      Instituted by Jesus Himself (Luke 22:19), it commemorates His sacrifice and anticipates His glorious
      return (1 Corinthians 11:24). The Lord’s Supper is not a means of salvation or grace and is only for
      believers who are not living in unrepentant sin (1 Corinthians 11:17-34).</li>
</ul>
<br/>
We believe and teach that the church is autonomous, free from external control, and has the right of self-
government (Acts 15:19-31). It&#39;s important for churches to cooperate with each other in spreading the faith,
but each local church, through its elders, determines its own methods of cooperation and governs its own
affairs (1 Corinthians 16:1-4).<br/><br/>
We believe and teach that the church is called to practice discipleship, mutual accountability, and discipline of
sinning members according to Scripture (Matthew 18:15-20).
